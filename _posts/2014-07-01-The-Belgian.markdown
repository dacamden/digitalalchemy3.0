After being declined to join Founders and Coders a couple of times I managed to persuade Dan to do the program from home with Helder. It's no secret that we both struggled to keep up from the first week on. As the pace kept going faster we could barely follow. We did some Skype calls while the Camden class was reviewing their code, but this was clearly not ideal. We thought of bailing out, but thinking of all the effort we did to get somewhat accepted we kept going!

Then on a rainy saturday at TW Classic, while watching the Rolling Stones I got an email from Dan saying 'Something came up'.... -battery dead-

Next morning, when I checked my emails I saw Dan's email again: 'Something came up...'. A little nervous I opened it and saw that 2 people bailed out. Dan asked if we would be interested in joining the Camden class... Offcourse we were! Well at least I was, Helder had already other obligations. As soon as Dan gave me a green light I booked a Eurotunnel ticket and left, not really thinking about where to sleep or wash my clothes. I figured sleeping in my car would be small sacrifise in exchange for this awesome course. So I left and set my GPS for Camden High Street. Four hours and 320 km later I arrived at Founders and Coders to join my new team, Digital Alchemy, ready to conquer - well, sort of - the digital world with exciting projects!

Yours truly
- Henri

PS I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Brian and Theo for hosting me! Also a big thanks to Leo -
