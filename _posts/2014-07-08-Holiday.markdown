Team Digital Alchemy took a few hits 2 weeks ago as one member left the course permanently and another went off sick. In that time the remaining two members joined other teams temporarily to continue the course. So no posts and no updates... until now. The team has gained a new member who has come all the way from Belgium to be with us. We admire your spirit Henry and welcome you as graciously as possible. We've also regained Leo who has returned after 2 weeks of.. well you don't want details. 

With the team back together there is a lot of catching up to do on the blog and we'll be working extra hard to ensure everything is up to scratch.

Yours truly
- Team Digital Alchemy
