Once more into the fray! Digital Alchemy bring you barcode wars/fights/battles... whatever.

The last two weeks of the Founders and Coders II course has each team selecting their own project to work on. Digital Alchemy has decided to produce a 2 player monster fighting game. The game is turn based and each players character is generated from a 13 digit barcode number.

Which barcode will rein supreme?
